	<h3><u>Preparation of the beans</u></h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Wash and soak beans in cold water for 1 hour😀</li>
		<li>Then, in a large pot and using 2 litres of water, boil your beans😂</li>
		<li>The pot should be partially closed. After ± 5 minutes, reduce the heat and simmer the beans for ± 1,5 hours, or until they are soft (mushy even)✊</li>
		<li>If more water is needed during the boil, add only boiling water to it. When the beans have cooked, drain them in a colander and set aside.😍</li>
		<li>In another pot, heat the oil and add the onions, garlic, chillies and ginger🧄</li>
		<li>After ± 3 minutes, stir in the mashed tomatoes and add your salt and pepper and/or seasoning cube🌶️</li>
		<li>Add water and cook for ± 10 minutes before stirring in the beans. Cook, stirring intermittently for 15 more minutes. Now they are ready for serving😋.</li>
